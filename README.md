Chrono: a simple Pebble app I wrote for a marriage proposal.
=================
PURPOSE
-----------------
The purpose was simple: I wanted a way to propose to my girlfriend that was 1) romantic 2) not TOO romantic 3) played on common interests of ours and 4) was a little geeky. 

To meet these goals, I designed Chrono. I chose to do this for the reasons above, as well as the fact that the Pebble was a birthday gift from my fianc√©e. Finally, pulling out a box and bending a knee in public is for actors in jewelry commercials!

DESIGN
-----------------
The design is very simple: the app, which runs as a fullscreen standalone app (as opposed to a watchface). The proposal is displayed as scrollable text.

I chose Chrono Trigger, the classic SNES RPG, as a theme for two reasons: First, she and I grew up playing a lot of video games and Chrono Trigger was always a favorite of ours. We discovered this fact the night we met, much to our mutual delight. Second, the Chrono (time) theme was apt considering the fact that the app was to run on a watch.

Most of the original proposal text has been removed from the source code because hey, some things have to remain private.

Enjoy!
